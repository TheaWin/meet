# Meet App

The Meet App will use serverless functions to fetch and filter public events from the Google Calendar API based on the user's selected city, manage the display of event details, and specify the number of events to show. These functions will handle real-time data processing, and scaling automatically to meet user demand. Also, the events will be displayed based on the location of the user’s interest, the serverless functions can easily integrate the geolocation service of the user’s choice as well as handling authentication with Google Calendar API.
